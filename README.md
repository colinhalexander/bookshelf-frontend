## BookShelf (v1.0.0)

This app, hosted [here](https://bookshelf-ad7a1.firebaseapp.com/) (frontend) and [here](https://bookshelf-backend-cha.herokuapp.com/) (backend), was created as a project for the Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering program. The frontend is built in React and the [backend](https://github.com/colinhalexander/bookshelf-backend) in Ruby on Rails. 

BookShelf is designed for users to search for books using the Google Books and NYT Books APIs, add them to their collections, set reading goals, and track their progress.

As of version 1.0.0, the app allows users to create a secure account (using JWT Auth), save books to preset collections, move books to different collections, and remove books from their collections. Future goals for the app include allowing users to create, delete, and rename collections, set general reading goals, set reading goals on individual books, and track their progress on all of their goals.
